1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Server-side routing is a routing method in which only the specific data that user asks for is downloaded, whether that be a new web page, some animations to display, or an input form. This results in a faster initial download speed of the data as opposed to downloading the whole application. 

    Client-side routing is a routing method in which the user downloads the whole application from the server. This results in a slower initial download speed, but allows for faster traversing through documents or components of the application.
